### Experimental Settings Comparison

| Feature | Setting A (Flexible) | Setting B (Urgent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Window Width** | Wider RDS windows | Tighter windows/deadlines |
| **Constraints** | Fewer pinned times | Frequent hard directives |
| **Staffing** | Sufficient levels | Reduced staffing (R=1) |
| **Goal** | One-shot feasibility | Test MIROE repairs |

The "Feasible" folder contains 1-9 scenarios with RDS generated by the SRO module that was feasible without the need of repair. The "Infeasible-Repair" folder contains 10-20 scenarios where with the RDS file generated by the SRO module for the first round, the MOREA module did not find any feasible schedule, and only becomes feasible after one round of repair. 

The graphs/diagrams for comparisons can be found in the Comparison Graphs folder.
