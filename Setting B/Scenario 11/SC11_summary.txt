Scenario SC11 (Setting B: initially infeasible → repaired) models a defence mission enclave with 44 devices across 10 VLAN segments, including gateway/DMZ access, a C2 service tier, identity core, an intelligence data tier, logistics planning, and security-operations tooling. The incident starts with a ransomware-like disruption affecting the mission file share (D18) and anomalous infrastructure behaviour (D15), raising immediate concerns about lateral spread into the intel-data segment (S4) and credential misuse.

The SRO produces a conservative RDS: it mandates rapid isolation of the intel-data segment (disconnect completed by bucket 2) and early identity hardening (lockdown on both AD nodes plus multiple credential resets within the first 3 buckets), while also requiring delayed reconnection to allow verification (reconnect earliest at bucket 12). Although each directive is reasonable in isolation, the initial RDS is infeasible due to an internal timing contradiction in the segment directive: with a fixed disconnect finish at bucket 2 and reconnect earliest at bucket 12, the implied isolation duration is at least 10 buckets, which violates the stated maxIsolationBuckets=8.

MIROE flags the specific conflicting RDS items and returns a minimal repair that preserves mission intent: increase maxIsolationBuckets from 8 to 12 while keeping the conservative reconnection delay unchanged. Under the repaired RDS, the model becomes feasible in Strict Mode, yielding a time-indexed, resource-feasible schedule that isolates the intel tier early, performs identity hardening under limited staffing, and supports a verified staged reconnection.
